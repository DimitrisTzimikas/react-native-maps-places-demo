A react native demo with use of react-native-google-place-picker & react-native-maps

To use: 
1) open git bash
2) write: git clone https://github.com/DimitrisTzimikas/react-native-maps-places-demo.git
3) then on git bash write "cd " and the name of the folder
4) on git bash: npm install

The configuration is only for Android because I could't test it on Mac. 
If someone can PR the iOS config fill free to do so.
